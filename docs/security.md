# Authentication & Security

Bamboo supports optional Bearer token authentication for HTTP-based
entrypoints. This is intended for internal deployments (e.g. CERN machines)
where controlled access to the MCP endpoint is required.

Authentication is enforced only for HTTP transports. The stdio entrypoint
does not use HTTP headers and therefore does not enforce Bearer tokens.

---

## Overview

When enabled, clients must send:

```Authorization: Bearer <token>```

on each HTTP request to `/mcp`.

If authentication is configured:

- Missing header → `401 Unauthorized`
- Malformed header → `401 Unauthorized`
- Invalid token → `403 Forbidden`

If no tokens are configured, authentication is disabled (useful for local development).

---

## Enabling Authentication

Authentication is enabled automatically when one of the following environment
variables is set:

### Option 1: Tokens file (recommended)

```BAMBOO_MCP_TOKENS_FILE=/path/to/tokens.txt```

Example `tokens.txt`:

Format: client_id: token

```
bamboo-cli: AAA...
bamboo-ui: BBB...
bamboo-ci: CCC...
```
Recommended permissions:

```chmod 600 tokens.txt```

### Option 2: Inline tokens

```BAMBOO_MCP_TOKENS="bamboo-cli:AAA,bamboo-ui:BBB"```


This is convenient for CI or containerized environments.

---

## Generating Tokens

Use the provided script:

```aiignore
python scripts/generate_tokens.py
    --client bamboo-cli
    --client bamboo-ui
    --bits 256
    --format tokens.txt
```


Default entropy is **256 bits**, which is cryptographically strong.

Tokens are generated using Python's `secrets` module.

---

## Security Model

### Token Properties

- 256-bit entropy by default
- Generated using `secrets.token_urlsafe`
- Compared using constant-time comparison (`secrets.compare_digest`)
- Never logged by the server

### Design Characteristics

- Stateless (each request must include the token)
- Tokens are loaded once at server startup
- Multiple tokens supported (per-client tokens recommended)
- Authentication is automatically disabled if no tokens are configured

---

## Recommended Deployment Pattern (CERN / Internal)

1. Bind HTTP server to `127.0.0.1`
2. Place behind a firewall or reverse proxy if exposing externally
3. Store tokens in `/etc/bamboo/tokens.txt`
4. Use per-client tokens
5. Rotate tokens by:
   - Adding new token
   - Updating client
   - Removing old token

---

## CI Integration

GitHub Actions workflow runs:

- flake8
- pylint
- pydocstyle
- pyright

Dev dependencies are listed in:

```requirements-dev.txt```

Install locally with:

```pip install -r requirements-dev.txt```


---

## Development Mode

If neither `BAMBOO_MCP_TOKENS_FILE` nor `BAMBOO_MCP_TOKENS` is set:

- Authentication is disabled
- HTTP endpoint is open (intended for local development only)

---

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

Possible future upgrades:

- Token hot-reload without restart
- Rate limiting
- IP allowlisting
- Integration with institutional SSO
- Structured audit logging per client_id

---

## Summary

Bamboo now supports:

- Per-client Bearer token authentication
- 256-bit secure token generation
- CI enforcement of style, linting, and type checking
- Dev-friendly defaults with secure production behavior

This keeps Bamboo lightweight while providing strong internal security.
