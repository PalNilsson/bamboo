"""Two-stage topic guardrail for the Bamboo MCP server.

Prevents the server from answering questions unrelated to PanDA, ATLAS, and
HEP workflow systems, thus avoiding unnecessary LLM costs.

Classification runs in two stages:

1. **Keyword fast-path** (free, synchronous) — matches known allow/deny
   terms against the lowercased question and returns immediately when a
   clear signal is found.

2. **LLM classification** (fast profile, ~50 tokens) — used only for
   questions that the keyword stage cannot classify confidently.  The model
   is instructed to be permissive: if there is any plausible connection to
   PanDA, ATLAS, or distributed HEP computing, the question is allowed.

On any LLM failure the guard **allows** the question through — a guardrail
failure must never silently block a legitimate user.  The failure is logged
to stderr.
