"""Bamboo answer tool — ATLAS-focused orchestration.

Routing (delegated to LLM planner)
------------------------------------
The original regex-based ``_route()`` dispatch has been replaced with a call
to :mod:`bamboo.tools.planner` (``bamboo_plan`` with ``execute=True``).

The planner receives:
  * the user question,
  * structured *hint* values extracted by the legacy regex helpers, and
  * the full conversation history,

and returns a synthesised natural-language answer via
:mod:`bamboo.tools.bamboo_executor`.

The regex hint-extractors (``_extract_task_id``, ``_extract_job_id``,
``_is_log_analysis_request``) are kept because they improve planner accuracy —
they do **not** drive routing decisions any more.
