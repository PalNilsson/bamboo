# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Bamboo** is a lightweight MCP-based runtime with a plugin architecture for AI-assisted scientific tools, primarily targeting ATLAS/PanDA workflows. LLMs are used for summarisation and explanation, not as sources of truth. Structured evidence is always fetched from BigPanDA, cached, and passed to the LLM; the raw API payload is kept available for inspection.

## Development Setup

```bash
# Install core and the ATLAS plugin in editable mode
pip install -e ./core
pip install -e ./packages/askpanda_atlas

## Architecture

### Core (`core/bamboo/`)

- **`core.py`** — Builds the MCP `Server` instance. Registers all built-in tools (see TOOLS registry below) and loads plugin tools via Python entry points (`bamboo.tools`). Implements all MCP handlers (`list_tools`, `call_tool`, `list_prompts`, `get_prompt`).
- **`server.py`** — Stdio transport entry point.
- **`config.py`** — Frozen `Config` dataclass driven entirely by environment variables (prefixed `ASKPANDA_*`).
- **`tracing.py`** — Structured request/response lifecycle tracing (opt-in via `BAMBOO_TRACE=1`). Emits NDJSON spans to stderr or a file (`BAMBOO_TRACE_FILE`). File and stderr are mutually exclusive — when the file is set, stderr is left clean (required for TUI compatibility). See `docs/tracing.md`.
- **`llm/`** — Multi-LLM abstraction layer. `factory.py` creates provider clients; `manager.py` routes by profile (`default`/`fast`/`reasoning`); `selector.py` picks profiles. Providers: `anthropic`, `openai`, `gemini`, `mistral`, `openai_compat`.

### TOOLS Registry (`core/bamboo/core.py`)

```python
TOOLS = {
    "bamboo_health":           bamboo_health_tool,        # Server status + LLM info
    "bamboo_llm_answer":       bamboo_llm_answer_tool,    # Raw LLM passthrough
    "bamboo_answer":           bamboo_answer_tool,        # Primary orchestration entry point
    "bamboo_plan":             bamboo_plan_tool,          # LLM-driven planner
    "bamboo_last_evidence":    bamboo_last_evidence_tool, # Retrieve last tool evidence for TUI
    "panda_doc_search":        panda_doc_search_tool,     # Vector RAG
    "panda_doc_bm25":          panda_doc_bm25_tool,       # BM25 keyword search

    "panda_jobs_query":        panda_jobs_query_tool,     # NL→SQL against ingestion DuckDB
    "cric_query":              cric_query_tool,            # NL→SQL against CRIC queuedata DuckDB
    "panda_harvester_workers": panda_harvester_workers_tool, # Harvester pilot/worker stats
    "panda_server_health":     panda_server_health_tool,  # PanDA server liveness via PanDA MCP
}
# panda_jobs_query, cric_query, panda_harvester_workers, and panda_server_health
# are conditionally added after the dict if askpanda_atlas is installed.
```

### Routing (`core/bamboo/tools/bamboo_answer.py`)

`BambooAnswerTool._route()` is the main routing method. Helpers extracted to keep cyclomatic complexity ≤ 15:

- **`_is_greeting(text)`** / **`_is_ack(text)`** — social intercept returning canned responses before the topic guard runs.
- **`_bypass_response(question, history)`** — delegates directly to `bamboo_llm_answer_tool` when `bypass_routing=True`.
- **`_run_topic_guard(question, history)`** — runs the topic guard and handles content-free followups (`"Tell me more"`). Returns `(rag_query, blocked)`.
- **`_resolve_contextual_ids(question, task_id, job_id, history)`** — fills in `task_id`/`job_id` from history for contextual follow-ups when the current question has none of its own. Two detection paths:
  1. **Explicit back-reference**: pronouns/demonstratives (`"those"`, `"them"`, `"that task"`, `"it"`) — always scans history.
  2. **Implicit short follow-up**: ≤ 10 words + status-specific domain term (`"failed"`, `"finished"`, `"running"`, etc.) — only applies the found ID if history actually contains one.
- **`_build_deterministic_plan(rag_query, task_id, job_id)`** — fast-path routing without an LLM call: job ID + analysis keywords → `panda_log_analysis`; job ID → `panda_job_status`; task ID → `panda_task_status`; pilot/Harvester signals (no IDs) → `panda_harvester_workers`; jobs DB signals (no IDs) → `panda_jobs_query`; no IDs → RAG retrieval. The pilot rule runs before the jobs DB rule because the word "pilot" can co-occur with jobs DB signal phrases.
- **`_is_pilot_question(question)`** — returns `True` when the question contains pilot/Harvester signal phrases (`"pilot"`, `"pilots"`, `"harvester worker"`, `"nworkers"`, `"pilot count"`, etc.) regardless of site or time expression. Used by the pilot fast-path intercept to bypass the topic guard for clearly on-topic pilot queries.
- **`_is_jobs_db_question(question)`** — returns `True` when the question contains site/status signal phrases (`"failed at"`, `"top errors"`, `"each status"`, `"last updated"`, etc.) and no `"task"` keyword. Used by the fast-path intercept to skip the topic guard for clearly on-topic jobs DB queries.
- **`_is_cric_question(question)`** — returns `True` when the question is about CRIC queuedata (queue status, copytools, site resources). Uses two strategies: (1) substring match against `_CRIC_SIGNALS` (phrases like `"cric"`, `"copytool"`, `"brokeroff"`, `"active queues"`, `"queue online"`, etc.); (2) presence of `"queue"`/`"queues"` AND a status word (`"active"`, `"online"`, `"offline"`, `"brokeroff"`) anywhere in the question — catches patterns like `"Which queues at BNL are active?"`. CRIC signals take priority over jobs signals in `_build_deterministic_plan`.
- **`_is_site_health_question(question)`** — returns `True` when the question contains signals from **both** `_PILOT_SIGNALS` and either `_JOBS_DB_SPECIFIC_SIGNALS` or any bare occurrence of the word `"job"` / `"jobs"` (matched with word boundaries via `re.search(r"\bjobs?\b", q)`). The word-boundary check handles natural phrasing like `"pilot and job failure rates"` without false-positives on `"how many pilots?"`. Questions with a `"task"` keyword are excluded.
- **`_JOBS_DB_SPECIFIC_SIGNALS`** — the job-specific subset of `_JOBS_DB_SIGNALS` used by `_is_site_health_question`. Excludes generic counting phrases (`"how many"`, `"count"`) and status-at phrases (`"ran at"`, `"failed at"`) that can appear in pure pilot questions.
- **`_extract_site_from_question(question)`** — extracts a computing site name using two strategies: (1) a contextual regex matching tokens after `at/for/from/site/queue` that filters out stop-words and requires the token to look like an ATLAS site (has digit, separator char, or is all-uppercase); (2) a short fallback list for sites used without a preposition. Handles arbitrary site names like MWT2, SLAC-SCS, CERN\_PROD, SWT2\_CPB without requiring them to be pre-registered.
- **`_extract_time_window_from_question(question)`** — translates natural-language temporal expressions into explicit ISO-8601 `(from_dt, to_dt)` pairs (UTC). Handles: `"last/past N hours/minutes/days"`, `"yesterday"`, `"since yesterday"`, `"today"`, explicit `"between ISO and ISO"` ranges. Returns `None` for `"right now"` / `"currently"` / no temporal expression, in which case the tool defaults to the last hour.

The **site-health fast-path** (in `_run_fast_path_intercepts`) builds a two-tool plan passing `site=<SITE>` to `panda_harvester_workers` **and** `queue=<SITE>` to `panda_jobs_query`. Both arguments are required for the tools to scope their queries to the same site; omitting `queue=` causes `panda_jobs_query` to query globally and return incorrect (all-site) statistics.

`bamboo_answer` accepts a `bypass_fast_path: bool` argument (default `False`). When `True`, both `_run_fast_path_intercepts()` and `_build_deterministic_plan()` are skipped — the question falls through to the topic guard and LLM planner. Exposed via the TUI `/fastpath off` command for testing planner routing on questions that would normally be short-circuited.
- **`_is_jobs_db_question(question)`** — returns `True` when the question contains site/status signal phrases (`"failed at"`, `"top errors"`, `"each status"`, `"which queues"`, `"last updated"`, etc.) and no `"task"` keyword. Used by the fast-path intercept to skip the topic guard for clearly on-topic DB queries.
- **`QUERYABLE_DATABASES`** — registry of queryable databases. Currently two entries: `"jobs"` (PanDA jobs ingestion DB) and `"cric"` (CRIC queuedata DB). When more than one entry is present, `_resolve_target_database()` is called to detect ambiguous questions; `_build_clarification_response()` prompts the user to specify which database they mean.

Routing order in `_route()`:
1. `bypass_routing` → direct LLM passthrough
2. Social intercept (greeting / ack)
3. **Fast-path intercepts** (`_run_fast_path_intercepts`) — contextual ID resolution first, then:
   - **PanDA server health** — liveness/health question (no IDs) → `panda_server_health`. Checked first, before site-health, so "is PanDA alive?" is never mistaken for a job or site question.
   - **Site-health** — both pilot AND job-specific signals present → `panda_harvester_workers` + `panda_jobs_query` in one plan. Checked before individual pilot/jobs to prevent the pilot check from firing alone.
   - **Pilot-only** — pilot signals, no job signals → `panda_harvester_workers`.
   - **Jobs DB / CRIC** — handled by `_run_db_query_fast_path()`, which performs multi-DB disambiguation: jobs signals → `panda_jobs_query`; CRIC signals → `cric_query`; ambiguous → clarification response. Both bypass the topic guard (~3s saved).
4. Topic guard + content-free followup reformulation
5. ID extraction from question, then contextual ID resolution from history
6. Deterministic fast-path plan
7. LLM planner fallback (`bamboo_plan` with `execute=True`)

### Execution (`core/bamboo/tools/bamboo_executor.py`)

`execute_plan()` iterates the plan's tool calls, calls each tool, and synthesises a grounded LLM answer. Key behaviour:

- After each successful tool call, the full evidence dict (including `raw_payload`) is stored in `_last_evidence_store[tool_name]`, with `pandaid_list` stripped (can be 50k entries — would cause `/inspect` timeouts). `raw_payload` and `pandaid_list` are both **stripped before LLM synthesis** so the LLM only sees the compact evidence fields. Both are accessible via `/json` and `/inspect` respectively.
- The compact JSON budget for each evidence block is **12,000 characters** (`_compact_json` limit), truncated with `…` if exceeded and sorted alphabetically. Task-level fields (`task_status`, `task_superstatus`, etc.) are merged first in the evidence dict so they sort before job-level fields.
- `BambooLastEvidenceTool` (`bamboo_last_evidence`) exposes the store via MCP. Accepts `mode="evidence"` (compact dict, `raw_payload` excluded) or `mode="raw"` (verbatim BigPanDA API response). Used by the TUI `/inspect` and `/json` commands.
- `_pick_synthesis_prompt(tool_names)` selects the system prompt for synthesis based on which tools ran: `panda_log_analysis` → log diagnostic; `panda_job_status` → job summary; `panda_task_status` → task summary; `panda_server_health` → PanDA liveness prompt; `panda_harvester_workers` + `panda_jobs_query` together → site-health prompt (two labelled evidence sources); `panda_harvester_workers` alone → pilot stats prompt; `panda_jobs_query` alone → jobs DB prompt; `cric_query` → CRIC queuedata prompt; `panda_doc_*` → RAG documentation; other → generic.

### LLM Passthrough (`core/bamboo/tools/llm_passthrough.py`)

Returns clean `resp.text` — no debug prefix in the response body. `get_llm_info()` helper exposes `"provider=<p> model=<m>"` for the TUI startup banner; called server-side (via `bamboo_health`) so the LLM selector is guaranteed to be initialised.

### Health (`core/bamboo/tools/health.py`)

`bamboo_health` includes `- llm_info: provider=<p> model=<m>` in its response text. The TUI parses this line at startup to display the LLM selection once.

### Plugin System

Tools are registered via `pyproject.toml` entry points under `bamboo.tools`:

```toml
[project.entry-points."bamboo.tools"]
"atlas.task_status" = "askpanda_atlas.task_status:panda_task_status_tool"
"atlas.ui_manifest" = "askpanda_atlas.ui_manifest:atlas_ui_manifest_tool"
"atlas.jobs_query"  = "askpanda_atlas.jobs_query:panda_jobs_query_tool"
```

Each plugin is a separate installable package under `packages/`. Core discovers plugins at startup via `importlib.metadata.entry_points`. The `TOOLS` dict keys (e.g. `"panda_task_status"`) are internal identifiers; MCP-exposed names come from `get_definition()["name"]`.

### ATLAS Plugin (`packages/askpanda_atlas/`)

#### HTTP Cache (`_cache.py`)

Thread-safe in-process TTL cache keyed on URL strings. Protects a `dict[str, (expiry_float, value)]` with a `threading.Lock`.

- `METADATA_TTL = 60.0` seconds — task and job metadata.
- `LOG_TTL = math.inf` — log files are immutable once written; cached forever.
- `cached_fetch_jsonish(url, timeout=30, ttl=METADATA_TTL)` — wraps `_fallback_http.fetch_jsonish`. Returns a 4-tuple `(status_code, content_type, body_text, parsed_json_or_none)`.
- `cached_fetch_log(url, timeout=60)` — wraps `requests.get`. Returns log text or `None` (404). `None` results are also cached (infinite TTL) to prevent re-requesting missing logs.
- `invalidate(url)`, `clear()`, `stats()` — cache management utilities. `clear()` is called by the TUI `/clear` command to flush HTTP state alongside context memory.

#### Task Status (`task_status_impl.py`)

Makes **two HTTP requests** per query:

1. `GET /jobs/?jeditaskid={task_id}&json` — full job list; used to build per-status/per-site/per-error-code counts via `build_evidence(PandaTaskData(payload))`.
2. `GET /task/{task_id}/?json` — task-level metadata; extracts the definitive `status` and `superstatus` fields (e.g. `"finished"`) that reflect the overall task outcome regardless of individual job failures. Best-effort — failure still returns job-level data.

The task-level fields (`task_status`, `task_superstatus`, `taskname`, `username`, `creationdate`, `starttime`, `endtime`, `dsinfo`, `pctfinished`, `totev`, `totevproc`, `task_monitor_url`) are merged into the evidence dict **before** job-level fields so they appear first in the sorted compact JSON sent to the LLM.

`_fetch_task_meta()` handles both BigPanDA response shapes: status nested under a `"task"` key or at the top level. Field name variants (`"status"` and `"taskstatus"`) are both tried. Failures are logged via `_trace()` to the bamboo trace file (visible in TUI `/tracing` even under `BAMBOO_QUIET=1`) and silently return `{}`.

Public surface:
- `fetch_and_analyse(base_url, task_id) -> dict` — synchronous; call via `asyncio.to_thread()`.
- `PandaTaskStatusTool` / `get_definition()` / `panda_task_status_tool` singleton.

All `bamboo.tools.base` imports are deferred inside `call()` — never at module level — so the module is importable without bamboo installed (required by the fallback shim).

#### Schema (`panda_task_schema.py`)

- `PandaJob` — wraps a raw job dict. Exposes typed properties (`pandaid`, `jobstatus`, `computingsite`, `piloterrorcode`, `jeditaskid`, etc.).
- `PandaTaskData` — wraps the full jobs-endpoint payload. Exposes `jobs: list[PandaJob]`, `selectionsummary`, `errsByCount`.
- `build_evidence(task)` — produces the compact evidence dict sent to the LLM: `jobs_by_status`, `jobs_by_site`, `jobs_by_piloterrorcode`, `errs_by_count`, `failed_jobs_sample` (≤ 20 slim dicts), `finished_jobs_sample` (≤ 5), `failed_pandaids` (flat `list[int]` of PanDA IDs from the failed sample — easier for LLMs to extract than digging through `failed_jobs_sample`), `task_summary`, and `pandaid_list` (inlined only when ≤ 500 jobs). Note: `pandaid_list` is stripped from the LLM synthesis input and the evidence store (can be 50k entries); it remains accessible only via `/json`.

#### Jobs Query (`jobs_query_impl.py`, `jobs_query_schema.py`)

NL→SQL tool that queries the local ingestion DuckDB file written by the `askpanda-ingestion-agent`. See [`docs/jobs-database.md`](../docs/jobs-database.md) for full documentation.

Pipeline: schema context (cached, 1 h TTL) → LLM SQL generation (temperature 0.0, max 512 tokens) → fence-strip → cannot-answer detection → AST guard (`sqlglot`, DuckDB dialect) → synchronous DuckDB execution → evidence dict.

Key design decisions:
- **AST guard** (`validate_and_guard`) enforces 7 rules: single statement, SELECT-only root, no DDL/DML/DCL/TCL anywhere in the tree, no system tables, no unknown tables (allow-list: `jobs`, `selectionsummary`, `errors_by_count`), LIMIT injection. Implemented with `sqlglot` AST inspection — never regex.
- **Synchronous execution** — DuckDB queries run on the event loop thread (2-15 ms typical). `asyncio.to_thread` was deliberately removed after macOS threading conflicts were diagnosed.
- **Datetime serialisation** — `_serialise_row()` converts `datetime`, `date`, and `Decimal` values to JSON-safe types before the evidence dict is serialised.
- **No bamboo-core import at module level** — `bamboo.llm.*` imports are deferred inside `_call_llm_for_sql()` so the module is importable without bamboo installed.
- `PANDA_DUCKDB_PATH` env var (default: `jobs.duckdb`) controls the database path.

Schema context and SQL generation prompt live in `jobs_query_schema.py`. The prompt includes six few-shot examples covering freshness queries, counts, group-by, errors, cross-queue ranking, and job listing.

#### Harvester Workers (`harvester_worker_impl.py`)

Fetches live Harvester pilot/worker counts from the BigPanDA Harvester API.

Endpoint: `GET /harvester/getworkerstats/?lastupdate_from=<ISO>&lastupdate_to=<ISO>[&computingsite=<SITE>]`

The API returns a JSON array of records, each describing `nworkers` for a specific combination of `computingsite`, `harvesterid`, `jobtype`, `resourcetype`, and `status`. Workers and pilots are synonymous in this context.

Public surface:
- `fetch_worker_stats(base_url, from_dt, to_dt, site) -> dict` — synchronous; call via `asyncio.to_thread()`. Fetches via `cached_fetch_jsonish` (30 s TTL — shorter than metadata TTL because pilot counts change frequently), extracts records from the `{"_data": [...]}` wrapper that `fetch_jsonish` produces for top-level JSON arrays, aggregates, and attaches `raw_payload`.
- `PandaHarvesterWorkersTool` / `get_definition()` / `panda_harvester_workers_tool` singleton.

Evidence structure (what the LLM sees — `raw_payload` is stripped before synthesis):
- `nworkers_total` — grand total across all statuses.
- `nworkers_by_status`, `nworkers_by_jobtype`, `nworkers_by_resourcetype`, `nworkers_by_site` — flat one-dimensional breakdowns, sorted by count descending.
- `pivot` — list of `{status, jobtype, resourcetype, nworkers}` dicts sorted by `nworkers` descending, summed across all harvester instances and sites. Bounded by `len(statuses) × len(jobtypes) × len(resourcetypes)` (≤ ~54 rows in practice). Allows the LLM to answer any combination of these three dimensions — including three-way slices like "running MCORE managed pilots" — without raw records.
- `total_records`, `from_dt`, `to_dt`, `site_filter`, `error`.

Site is excluded from the pivot deliberately: scoped queries should use `site_filter` on the API call, making the pivot already site-specific. For all-sites queries, `nworkers_by_site` covers per-site totals.

Key design decisions:
- **`asyncio.to_thread` for HTTP** — unlike DuckDB (which must run on the event loop thread), HTTP fetches are safe with the thread pool on all platforms.
- **30 s cache TTL** — pilot counts change much more frequently than task/job metadata; the standard 60 s TTL would give stale answers to "right now" questions.
- **Time window defaults to last hour** — `_default_window()` is called when `from_dt`/`to_dt` are absent from `arguments`, so the tool always has a valid query window.
- **Temporal extraction happens at the router, not the tool** — `_extract_time_window_from_question()` in `bamboo_answer.py` translates natural-language time expressions (`"since yesterday"`, `"last 6 hours"`, `"today"`, explicit ISO ranges) into `from_dt`/`to_dt` before the fast-path plan is built. The tool itself is stateless with respect to time.

Entry point registration in `pyproject.toml`:
```toml
"atlas.harvester_workers" = "askpanda_atlas.harvester_worker:panda_harvester_workers_tool"
```

#### Harvester Timeseries (`harvester_timeseries_impl.py`)

Fetches per-bucket pilot counts from the OpenSearch `atlas_harvesterworkers-*` index for a single status over a time window. Used exclusively by the TUI for rendering ASCII time-series charts — it is **not** routed through `bamboo_answer` and has no LLM synthesis prompt.

Endpoint: OpenSearch `atlas_harvesterworkers-*` index via `date_histogram` aggregation on `@timestamp`.

Public surface:
- `compute_interval(from_dt, to_dt) -> str` — derives a `fixed_interval` string targeting ≈12–20 buckets: ≤30 min → `1m`, ≤3 h → `5m`, ≤12 h → `15m`, else `1h`.
- `fetch_timeseries(status, from_dt, to_dt, site, interval) -> list[dict]` — synchronous; call via `asyncio.to_thread()`. Creates a fresh OpenSearch client per call, applies optional `computingSite.keyword` filter, caches results for 60 s via `_cache._set/_get`.
- `PandaHarvesterTimeseriesTool` / `get_definition()` / `panda_harvester_timeseries_tool` singleton.

Evidence structure (returned to the TUI, not sent to the LLM):
- `status` — the status that was queried.
- `interval` — the `fixed_interval` used (e.g. `"1m"`, `"5m"`).
- `buckets` — list of `{"timestamp": str, "count": int}` dicts in ascending order.
- `total_buckets`, `from_dt`, `to_dt`, `site_filter`, `endpoint`, `error`.

Key design decisions:
- **Display-only tool** — called directly from `_try_auto_chart()` in the TUI after a `panda_harvester_workers` answer; never appears in a `bamboo_answer` plan.
- **Entry point name is the call name** — `core.py` overwrites `get_definition()["name"]` with the entry point key for plugin tools. The TUI must call it as `"atlas.harvester_timeseries"`, not `"panda_harvester_timeseries"`.
- **OpenSearch auth** — the cluster at `os-atlas.cern.ch` requires Kerberos (SPNEGO). On lxplus a valid `kinit` ticket is sufficient. Local use requires CERN VPN; Basic auth (`ASKPANDA_OPENSEARCH` + `ASKPANDA_OPENSEARCH_USER`) works only if the network path accepts it.
- **Cert verification** — set `ASKPANDA_OPENSEARCH_VERIFY_CERTS=false` to skip TLS verification when the CERN CA bundle is unavailable locally.

Entry point registration in `pyproject.toml`:
```toml
"atlas.harvester_timeseries" = "askpanda_atlas.harvester_timeseries:panda_harvester_timeseries_tool"
```

#### Chart Utilities (`chart_utils.py`)

Pure ASCII chart rendering for Harvester evidence. No I/O, no bamboo dependency — importable and testable independently.

Public surface:
- `ascii_status_bar(evidence, bar_width)` — horizontal bar chart of `nworkers_by_status`, sorted by count descending. Includes window label and grand total.
- `ascii_pivot_table(evidence, top_n)` — fixed-width table of the top `top_n` rows from the `pivot` list, broken down by status × jobtype × resourcetype.
- `ascii_timeseries(buckets, status, width, height)` — vertical bar chart with `@timestamp` buckets on the X-axis and worker count on the Y-axis. Y-axis shows min/max/mid tick labels. Adapted from `ascii_histogram` in `opensearch_monitor.py`.
- `render_chart(evidence, width, mode)` — dispatcher. Modes: `"auto"` (status bar if `nworkers_by_status` present, else pivot), `"status"`, `"pivot"`, `"timeseries"`.

#### Log Analysis (`log_analysis_impl.py`)

- `_fetch_metadata` uses `cached_fetch_jsonish` (60 s TTL).
- `_fetch_log_text` uses `cached_fetch_log` (infinite TTL).

### Textual TUI (`interfaces/textual/chat.py`)

#### Slash Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/help` | Show command reference |
| `/tools` | List MCP tools |
| `/task <id>` | Shorthand: status of task `<id>` |
| `/job <id>` | Shorthand: analyse failure of job `<id>` |
| `/json` | Verbatim BigPanDA API response for last query (yellow panel) |
| `/inspect` | Compact evidence dict for last query — what the LLM saw (cyan panel) |
| `/chart` | Re-display the ASCII pilot chart for the last Harvester query (status bar + timeseries if available) |
| `/tracing` | Timing and trace spans for last request |
| `/history` | Conversation turns in context memory |
| `/plugin <id>` | Switch active plugin |
| `/debug on\|off` | Toggle tool call + raw result display |
| `/fastpath on\|off` | Toggle deterministic fast-path routing. `off` bypasses all fast-path intercepts and `_build_deterministic_plan`, forcing the LLM planner to handle all routing. Useful for testing planner coverage on questions that would normally be short-circuited. Default: `on`. |
| `/costs` | Show estimated LLM token cost for the last request, broken down by model call. Reads `input_tokens`/`output_tokens` from `llm_call` trace spans and prices them from `_MODEL_COST_PER_MTOK`. Requires `BAMBOO_TRACE=1`. |
| `/clear` | Clear transcript, context memory, and HTTP cache |
| `/exit`, `/quit` | Exit |

Arrow-up/down in the input field navigates command history (consecutive duplicates are deduplicated).

#### LLM Info Display

At startup, the TUI calls `bamboo_health` via MCP and parses the `- llm_info:` line from the response. Displayed once in the connected system message:

```
Connected via stdio. Answer tool: bamboo_answer.
[LLM selected] provider=mistral model=mistral-large-latest
```

#### Thinking Animation

`_write_thinking()` uses `self.set_interval(1.0, _tick)` (Textual-native timer) to cycle `Thinking.` → `Thinking..` → `Thinking...` with the current wall-clock time (`datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%H:%M:%S")`) updated each frame. Cancelled via `timer.stop()` in `_replace_thinking()`.

`asyncio.ensure_future` + `asyncio.sleep` was deliberately avoided — it caused 60× speed issues when the Textual event loop competed with blocking MCP worker threads.

#### Cost Estimation (`/costs`)

`_estimate_cost(spans)` reads every `llm_call` span from `_last_spans`, looks up per-token pricing from `_MODEL_COST_PER_MTOK` (a `Dict[str, tuple]` of `(input_rate_per_Mtok, output_rate_per_Mtok)` in USD), and returns a breakdown dict. Unknown models fall back to `_DEFAULT_COST_PER_MTOK` ($1.00/$3.00 per Mtok) and are flagged in the output.

The pricing table covers Mistral, Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google models. To add a new model, extend `_MODEL_COST_PER_MTOK` in `interfaces/textual/chat.py` — no restart needed as the dict is read at command time.

**Important**: the planner (`bamboo_plan`) previously emitted no trace spans, so its token usage was invisible to `/costs`. It now emits an `llm_call` span with `tool="bamboo_plan"`, so `/fastpath off` queries correctly show two LLM call rows — the planning call and the synthesis call.

#### Auto-Chart (`_try_auto_chart`)

After every `bamboo_answer` response, `_try_auto_chart()` runs as a post-processing step. It makes up to two additional MCP calls:

1. **`bamboo_last_evidence(mode="evidence")`** — retrieves the snapshot evidence. If `tool != "panda_harvester_workers"` or `len(nworkers_by_status) <= 1`, returns immediately.
2. **`atlas.harvester_timeseries`** — fetches per-bucket counts for the status extracted from the user's question. Skipped if the tool is not registered (i.e. `opensearch-py`/`opensearch-dsl` not installed or `ASKPANDA_OPENSEARCH` not set).

Two panels are written on success:
- `pilot chart` (green) — `ascii_status_bar` from snapshot evidence.
- `pilot timeseries (<status>)` (green) — `ascii_timeseries` from OpenSearch buckets.

Client-side helpers (module-level in `chat.py`, no bamboo-core import):
- `_extract_status_from_question(question)` — returns the first matching status from `_HARVESTER_STATUSES`; defaults to `"running"`.
- `_extract_window_from_question(question)` — mirrors `bamboo_answer._extract_time_window_from_question`; returns `(from_dt, to_dt)` or `None`.

All failures in `_try_auto_chart` are swallowed silently (`except Exception: pass`) so a chart error never disrupts the main answer.

The `/chart` slash command manually re-triggers the same rendering from the stored evidence, useful after scrolling past the auto-rendered chart.

### PanDA MCP Integration (`packages/askpanda_atlas/`)

#### Session Wiring (`panda_mcp_session.py`)

Bamboo connects to the external PanDA MCP server at startup and holds the session open for the process lifetime. The session is registered with the process-wide `MCPCaller` under the name `"panda"`.

**Known working endpoint:** `https://aipanda120.cern.ch:8443/mcp/` (streamable-HTTP transport, no auth token required as of March 2026).

**Startup:**
- `core/bamboo/server.py` (stdio): `asyncio.create_task(run_panda_mcp_session(shutdown_event))` before entering `stdio_server()`.
- `core/bamboo/entrypoints/http.py` (ASGI): `_startup_panda_mcp()` is called from the `lifespan.startup` handler; teardown is wired into `_shutdown()`.

If `PANDA_MCP_BASE_URL` is not set, the session helper logs a warning and exits immediately — tools that need it return a graceful `"server not connected"` error rather than crashing.

**Transport:** The `aipanda120.cern.ch` server runs the MCP streamable-HTTP transport (despite returning a `406 Not Acceptable` to bare GET requests — that is the correct MCP protocol response). Do **not** set `PANDA_MCP_USE_SSE=1` for this endpoint.

**TLS outside CERN:** The server uses a certificate signed by the CERN Grid CA. Python's `httpx` uses the `certifi` bundle by default, which does not include the CERN Grid CA. Two options:

1. **Append the CERN CA to certifi** (permanent, recommended for shared installs):
   ```bash
   # Download and convert CERN Root CA 2
   curl -o /tmp/cern-root-ca2.der \
     "https://cafiles.cern.ch/cafiles/certificates/CERN%20Root%20Certification%20Authority%202.crt"
   openssl x509 -inform DER -in /tmp/cern-root-ca2.der -out /tmp/cern-root-ca2.pem
   # Download CERN Grid CA intermediate (note the (1) in the filename)
   # Extract directly from the server since the CERN website redirects unreliably:
   openssl s_client -connect aipanda120.cern.ch:8443 -showcerts 2>/dev/null </dev/null \
     | openssl x509 -out /tmp/cern-server.pem
   # Append root CA to certifi bundle
   cat /tmp/cern-root-ca2.pem >> $(python3 -c "import certifi; print(certifi.where())")
   ```
   Then set `PANDA_MCP_CA_BUNDLE` if the intermediate is also needed.

2. **Disable verification** (development/testing only):
   ```bash
   export PANDA_MCP_TLS_VERIFY=0
   ```
   This prints a warning at startup and should never be used in production.

On **lxplus** and other CERN machines, the CERN Grid CA is in the system store and `ssl.create_default_context()` finds it automatically — no extra configuration needed.

Authentication is passed as HTTP headers (`Authorization: Bearer <token>` and `Origin: <vo>`), matching the PanDA Server authentication model described in the PandaMCP documentation. The `aipanda120.cern.ch` endpoint does not currently require a token.

#### PanDA Server Health (`panda_server_health.py`)

Calls the `is_alive` tool on the `"panda"` MCP session. The first (and currently only) tool that delegates to the PanDA MCP server.

Evidence structure:
- `is_alive: bool` — true if the server is alive.
- `raw_response: str | None` — first 500 chars of the raw response.
- `error: str | None` — null on success.

The `_parse_alive(raw)` helper handles plain-string (`"True"` / `"false"`) and JSON (`{"alive": true}`) responses.

**Mocking pattern** (important — differs from other tools):

Because `get_mcp_caller` is imported **inside `call()` at runtime** (required by the no-bamboo-core-at-module-level rule), it cannot be patched via `monkeypatch.setattr("askpanda_atlas.panda_server_health.get_mcp_caller", ...)`. Instead, patch the process-wide singleton directly:

```python
monkeypatch.setattr(
    "bamboo.tools._mcp_caller._mcp_caller",
    _make_caller(text="True"),
)
```

The same pattern applies to any future PanDA MCP tool that uses deferred imports.

#### Adding More PanDA MCP Tools

The session wiring is complete — adding a new PanDA MCP tool only requires steps 3–5 from the original plan:

1. Create `packages/askpanda_atlas/askpanda_atlas/panda_mcp_<toolname>.py` following `panda_server_health.py` exactly.
2. Use `_SERVER = "panda"` and `_TOOL = "<actual_tool_name_on_server>"`.
3. Register in `pyproject.toml` entry points, `core.py` TOOLS dict, `bamboo_answer.py` fast-path, `bamboo_executor.py` synthesis prompt, `planner.py` routing rule.
4. Add to `test_narrow_waist.py` TOOLS and `_STUB_ARGS`.
5. Write `tests/test_panda_mcp_<toolname>.py`.

## Key Conventions

### Code Quality

All code must pass:
- `flake8` — max complexity 15 (`max-complexity = 15`), max line length 120.
- `pydocstyle` — Google-style docstrings. First line must be imperative mood (D401). Magic methods need docstrings (D105).
- `pyright` — strict type checking. Use `Sequence[Any]` (covariant) instead of `list[Message]` for function parameters that are only read, not mutated.

### Docstrings

Every public function, method, and class must have a Google-style docstring. The first line must be imperative: write `"Return ..."` not `"Returns ..."`, `"Fetch ..."` not `"Fetches ..."`.

### Tool Implementation Pattern

Each tool module must export:
- `get_definition() -> dict` — MCP tool definition.
- A tool class with `get_definition()` and `async call(arguments: dict) -> list[MCPContent]`.
- A module-level singleton (two blank lines before it — E305).

`bamboo.tools.base` imports (`text_content`, `MCPContent`) must be **deferred inside `call()`**, never at module level, so the module remains importable without bamboo installed.

### Tool Results

`call()` never raises — all errors are returned as `text_content(json.dumps({"error": "..."}))`. The evidence dict always includes `task_id` / `job_id` and `endpoint` fields. `raw_payload` is stored in the evidence dict but stripped before LLM synthesis by `bamboo_executor.execute_plan()`.

### HTTP Cache Mock Pattern

All tests that mock HTTP calls must patch `"askpanda_atlas._cache.cached_fetch_jsonish"` (not `_fallback_http.fetch_jsonish`). Mock signatures must include `timeout`:

```python
def _ok_response(raw): return (200, "application/json", json.dumps(raw), raw)
def _err_response(status=404): return (status, "text/html", "", None)

# In tests:
with patch("askpanda_atlas._cache.cached_fetch_jsonish",
           lambda url, timeout=30: _ok_response(raw)):
    ...
```

### LLM Responses

`llm_passthrough.py` returns clean `resp.text` — no debug prefix. The `[LLM selected]` line appears only once per session in the TUI startup system message, sourced via `bamboo_health`.
