"""Pytest configuration.

These tests are designed to work both when Bamboo is installed (editable or
wheel) and when running directly from a source checkout.

In a clean checkout, the `bamboo` (core) and `askpanda_atlas` (plugin) packages
live under `core/` and `packages/askpanda_atlas/` respectively. Add these
directories to `sys.path` so `pytest` can import them without requiring an
editable install.
