"""Plan executor for Bamboo — runs a validated :class:`~bamboo.tools.planner.Plan`.

This module provides the execution layer that sits between the planner and the
LLM synthesiser.  Given a ``Plan`` produced by :mod:`bamboo.tools.planner`, it:

1. Iterates ``plan.tool_calls`` in order.
2. Resolves each tool via the core ``TOOLS`` registry or the plugin entry-point
   loader.
3. Validates arguments with :func:`~bamboo.core._validate_arguments`.
4. Calls ``await tool.call(args)`` and collects ``list[MCPContent]``.
5. Unpacks JSON evidence from evidence tools.
6. Selects a synthesis system prompt based on which tools were called.
7. Synthesises a final natural-language answer via the LLM.

All functions are intentionally **pure orchestration** — no experiment-specific
logic lives here.  Synthesis prompts are kept as module-level constants so they
can be updated independently of routing logic.

    ``_last_evidence_store``.  This tool exposes that store so the TUI
    ``/json`` and ``/inspect`` commands can retrieve it without making a
    fresh HTTP request to BigPanDA.

    Two modes (controlled by the ``mode`` argument):

    ``"evidence"`` (default)
        The compact structured evidence dict — job counts, site breakdown,
        error tallies, sample job records.  This is what was sent to the LLM.

    ``"raw"``
        The verbatim BigPanDA API response stored under
        ``evidence["raw_payload"]``, if present.  Falls back to the full
        evidence dict if ``raw_payload`` is absent.
