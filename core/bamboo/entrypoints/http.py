"""
Bamboo MCP HTTP entrypoint (Streamable HTTP, ASGI).

This module exposes Bamboo's MCP server over HTTP using the MCP Python SDK's
StreamableHTTPServerTransport. The transport in this MCP build requires:

- StreamableHTTPServerTransport(mcp_session_id=...)
- `async with transport.connect(): ...` must be entered before `handle_request(...)`
- `handle_request(scope, receive, send)` writes the HTTP response via ASGI `send`
  and returns None.

Important implementation detail:
The first HTTP request can arrive before the background connect task has entered
`transport.connect()`. To avoid a race, we maintain an asyncio.Event per session
that is set immediately after connect() is entered. Request handling awaits that
event before calling handle_request().

Run:
  uvicorn bamboo.entrypoints.http:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
